<p>My dad always taught me to “make your money work for you.”</p>

<p>This refers to the idea of gaining a cashflow while you are not working, rather than work for an hourly wage or salary.</p>

<p>This is a common theme among digital nomads today. Most achieve this outcome by creating a <a href="http://expertvagabond.com/paid-to-travel-world/">high traffic blog</a> or Saas application.</p>

<p>Outside of having your money work for you, you might be working free lance or on contract with a company.</p>

<p><strong><em>commonly found is a combination of the two</em></strong></p>

<p>Sounds complicated with a lot of floating pieces, right?</p>

<p><strong><em>Your’e right.</em></strong></p>

<p>Not only is it difficult to manage separate projects, it is difficult to account for how your income might be effected, or even slightly resemble on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>After all, our world is structured for a month to month balance of income and expenses.</p>

<p>When visiting Sweden, local friends of mine explained that the culture is straight line, vanilla 🍦. Risk is not highly tolerated and you follow in your lane.</p>

<p>If risk is not tolerated, how does Stockholm produces the <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-stockholm-became-a-unicorn-factory/">highest number of so-called “unicorns” per capita</a>, after San Francisco?</p>

<p>Well one idea, amongst great infrastructure, is in the antithesis of cultural risk taking: <strong>stability</strong>.</p>

<p>My friend explained to me -</p>

<p>“Stockholm has so many startups because the guy or gal in their garage knows that if they fail, they will have the support of the government to catch them.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t have to rely on a job to provide her healthcare, or education, or basic living essentials.”</p>

<p>“So really, the risk of starting something is quite small.”</p>

<p>What if this idea could be captured and collectively practiced amongst like-minded individuals?</p>

<p>If a group of people could come together to support one another in achieving a small portion of base income, they would propel one another by distributing risk.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Risk of not having work.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Risk of losing an opportunity to further one’s education.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Risk of starting a business.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been toying with the idea. More to come 🔜</p>
